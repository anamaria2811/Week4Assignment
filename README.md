# Week4Assignment

This repository is created within the week4 assignment for preparing tidy data that can be used for later analysis.
The data used represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
The script run_analysis.R cleans the data following the next steps:
1. Download the data file and unzip it in your local directory.
2. Read the files
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
4. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
6. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
7. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The output of the script is the file tidy_data.txt
